## What are  ~AI~  IO Agents?

### IO Agents are Autonomous

IO Agents are at the cutting edge of interactive AI, designed to bring a multidimensional presence to your digital and physical spaces. Here’s what makes them revolutionary:

- **3D Interaction and Overlay Integration:** IO Agents can speak and move in 3D environments, integrating seamlessly into your OverlayX layer in preferred live-streaming tools like OBS or StreamLabs. They enhance live streaming by adding a dynamic, interactive element to your content.
- **Personalized Intelligence:** With advanced learning capabilities, IO Agents delve into your life history, preferences, and tastes. This enables them to plan, decide, and interact in ways that feel deeply personal and intuitive.
- **Environmentally Aware:** These agents are not confined to a single interface. They interact with a broad range of inputs and outputs, including chats, smart devices, webcams, overlays, IOXtream experiences, and social networks, creating a truly connected ecosystem.

### Unique Memories and Private Consciousness

Every IO Agent is more than just a digital tool; it’s a unique companion built on blockchain technology with an emphasis on individuality and privacy:

- **Your Live Entertainment Co-Pilot:** As your virtual ally, your IO Agent learns to behave like your best friend, understanding your habits and preferences to assist and engage effectively.
- **Account-Linked Consciousness:** IO Agents retain their memories tied to your IOXtream account. If transferred or sold, they retain only basic knowledge of their prior experience but lose all specific details linked to your account. To reconnect with their full memory bank, the same IO Agent must be linked back to the original account, ensuring privacy and personalization.

### Truly Unique and Immutable Characteristics
At IOXtream, we’re not about the generic NFT hype or "new protocols”. IO Agents are singular creations, each featuring immutable attributes that make them one of a kind:
- **Five Core Settings:** Every IO Agent comes with five randomized, unchangeable characteristics:
  - **Primary Color**
  - **Secondary Colors**
  - **Voice Tone**
  - **Sociability**
  - **Mood**

- **Immutable Behavioral Traits:**
  - Voice Tone: Ranging from the deepest pitch (1) to the highest (777).
  - Sociability: A spectrum from introverted (1) to extroverted (777).
  - Mood Spectrum: Fourteen distinct positive moods:
    - Calm/Peaceful (1–100)
    - Grateful/Appreciative (80–150)
    - Hopeful/Confident (130–200)
    - Excited/Energized (180–250)
    - Happy/Jovial (230–300)
    - Delighted/Inspired (280–350)
    - Creative/Productive (330–400)
    - Motivated/Dedicated (380–450)
    - Proud/Accomplished (430–500)
    - Loving/Affectionate (480–550)
    - Nostalgic/Wistful (530–600)
    - Dreamy/Optimistic (580–650)
    - Ecstatic/Euphoric (630–769)
    - Transcendent/Elevated (770–777)

- **Colors and Rarity**:
  - The first colors will forever be attached to the IO Agent, but colors are the only trait that you can try to change by randomizing once daily. The chances for each new color are:
    - Common - Basic colors (90%)
    - Uncommon - Silver (8%)
    - Special - Gold (1.4%)
    - Rare – Fade (0,2%)
    - Ultra Rare – Ruby (0,1%)
    - Ultra Rare – Sapphire (0,1%)
    - Ultra Rare – Emerald (0,1%)
    - Ultra Rare – Diamond (0,1%)

Every time you manage to transform one of the colors of your IO Agent into a color with higher rarity, that color will forever be available for use with that IO Agent, even if you sell it.

This unique combination of attributes ensures that every IO Agent is as distinctive as its user, fostering a sense of ownership and individuality.

### The Future of Interactive AI
IO Agents redefine how we perceive and interact with AI. From their ability to coexist in real-time environments to their unique, immutable characteristics, they’re more than just technology – they’re companions tailored to enhance your experiences and redefine digital interactions.
