## IO - The Ghost of Web3
IO is not just our mascot but a narrative interwoven with Web3 technologies. Originally conceived as a "ghost bug" in the digital realm, IO’s story is built on innovation, community, and the exploration of new immersive experiences.

It all started as a simple idea to connect the real and virtual worlds, using the internet to create interactive experiences during live broadcasts. Now, it continues as a true revolution in scalable live experiences.
IO’s journey is marked by its commitment to open-source principles and the creation of an engagement network that enables direct cryptocurrency donations during live streams, fully embracing the spirit of peer-to-peer interactions.
